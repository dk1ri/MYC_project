#The MYC Project 

MYC is a universal system to control hardware and software. A MYC system can merge different IOT systems and programms using a common user interface.

It can be seen as a "glue" for microservices.
A MYC system contains skins and funcs (and a few other components)
A skin is a user interface, which can be selected and configured by the user - or a remote control or a simple switch.
A func is something, what can be controlled as a device or a program.
skin + func = App (or something similar)
The connection between skin and func is done by the (OSI layer 7) MYC protocol. The other OSI layer can be selected by demand.

MYC is not ready, you are invited to contribute
