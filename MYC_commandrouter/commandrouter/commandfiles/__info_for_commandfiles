# command input file (to check commands)
# ======================================
# 
## !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Errors in the commandfiles may crash the programm
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#
# These files test the correct generation of v_linelength-command and the correct function of the modul data_handling.
# Because v_lenlength.answer is generated in the same way as v_linelength.command and inputs from devices sre
# handled byy data_handling checking of answers is not necessary.
# checks are done with operate and answer commands from SK only.
#
# tests are initiated by a<n><SPACE> from the terminal, where n is the number of the 
# _commandfile_test<n>.
#
# The program will send some info to the terminal to shown wheather the command workes correct
# or errors from the input are detected.
# 
# comments (line starting with #) are allowed
# requires same syntax as for inputs on the terminal (ASCII values separated by space)
# numbers > 255 will crash the programm
#
# there must be 4 lines for each command:
# lines not used must be empty
# 1 - number_of_command announceline	for info
# 2 - command from SK			send
# 3 - output to device			required
# 4 - either "shold be ok" or "should produce an error"
#
# Commands, which are handled by the CR have no output to a device.
# The output to the terminal must be checked directly
