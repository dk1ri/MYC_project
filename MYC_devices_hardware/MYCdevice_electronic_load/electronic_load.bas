'
'Something about the programm design:
'This programm workes with 1 to 7 FETs IRFP150:
'Vmax = 90V (100V)
'Imax = 30A   (at 100 degC)
'Ptot = 200W
'Ron = 50mOhm
'so the minimum voltage to be applied and will work under all conditions is
' (10mOhm resistor for measuring)
' (50 + 10 mOhm) * 30A = 1,8V
' If current (per FET) is lower, lower Voltage can be used
'
'All internal calculation are in V, A and W and Ohm

'The resolution used by commands is 10mV, 10mA, 10mW and 10mOhm. Some rounding is done.

'The effective voltage resolution is nominal 88mV (2,562 / 2,56) * ( 90V / 1023)
' (2.562V at AD input with 90V)

'Because the AD converter needs 4 - 5 steps for an acceptable accuracy
'the el load will not switch on for voltages below 400mV (AD Converter = 4)
'
'The current resolution is nominal 29mA
' (30A *0.01Ohm * (154kOhm / 18kOhm) / 2,56V)*(30 / 1023)
'so the minimum current (1 Fet active) to be applied for an acceptable current result
'is 120mA (AD Converter = 4)
'
'The minimum resistor value of the load is
' (50mOhm + 10mOhm + 3mOhm) / 7 ~ 9 mOhm  (3mOhm: wire)
'The maximum is given by the max voltage and the minimum current:
' 90V / 28mA ~ 3kOhm
'The required resistor has a range from 10 mOhm to 3.000.000 mOhm
'
'The usable maximum power depends on cooling and may be modified.
'default value is 50W per fet (350W total)
'Absolute maximimum is 1400W with IRFP150
' The range is 0 W to 1400.00 W
'
'To improve accuracy the number of used FETs is as low as possible
'So the requested power is either given or calculated, when the voltage is applied
'If the requested power is < n * (max_power_per_FET * 0.8) then only n FETs are used
'starting with 1st active FET.
'If the current or power exceeds the max value a additional FET is added
'
'The gate voltage is modified for all used FETs in turn by a specific value
'The current should be similar for all FETs to have a good power distribution.
'Therefore the check of power during measurement ist done on a per FET base only.
'
'Because the current of different FETs varies with same Fet Gate voltage, the gate
'voltage of a FET is changed only if the current to modify will decrease the spread
'of all currents; otherwise this FET is skipped.
