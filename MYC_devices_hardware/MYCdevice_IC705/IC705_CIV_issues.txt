ICOM CIV Issues and comments for IC705
202102018
Author: DK1RI

Used IC705 firmware version: 1.20
CIV Manual Version: september 2020
additions coming with firmware 1.20
IC705 converter programm (python) version: V01.3

My restrictions:
I use my IC705 at the current holiday qth in EA8 only. There I have written the CIV converter program.
I have basic DStar knowledge only. I used it a few times in DL with the IC9700.
There is no other DStar station nearby. I have no access to the internet router to install port forwarding.
So I did not found the reason for some of the coresponding command limitations.
Due to local limitations here I cannot use CIV and GPS at the same time.

Limitations:
I tried to write a working CIV converter working for all CIV commands for the IC705.
Obviously some commands are not working under all conditions. I found some restrictions, but did not systematically check
any command under all possible conditions. So there may be other non working conditions, which I did not found. 
I did not checked the IC705 systematically for missing CIV codes.

Summary:
CIV is a very old protocol. The first radios with this protocol - as x71 -  had - except the frequency and mode - 
few other CIV controls only.
Over the time the radios got more functions and ICOM tried at the beginning to have the same control codes
for the same function for later radios.
But this did not work anymore. The 1a05 commands usually have different codes for the same function.
But ICOM tried to keep the sequence of the functions for different radios.
So the code numbering system is a little bit curious and complicate the converter programming, but ok.

Some inconsistencies came up over the time, comparing older and newer commands:
- parameters are 0-based or 1-based.
- discrete paramter values numbered from 0 to .. or as exact values (as for tone frequencies).
- wrong command is ignored (as scan resume) or CIV error sent.
- for some commands novalid is ff only, some commands have length as defined.
Icom obviously used the same programming code for different radios.
Some of the issues were found with the IC7300. I sent them to ICOM two (?) years ago.

Most of the issues below are (or seem to be) not ducumemnnted missing conditions for work.
Sometimes I found those rules in the other manuals. But I exspect everything in the CIV reference manual as well.
So I did not checked the other manuals systematically for those issues.
It is ok for simplification of manual handling reasons not to show all configurations (eg depending 
on the mode). 
Some commands cannot be used depending on other commands: format of RTTY log file should not be changed,
when logfile is on in RTTY mode, but can be modified under all other conditions (assuming, that file is closed in non RTTY mode)
Most limitations are similar cases: the limitation make sense under very specfic circumstances only.
Some limitations are documentended, others (most of them) are not.
If you want to program a knowledge based (some peoaple call it "intelligent") system, you must know all limititaions (rules).

Earlier radios had obviously all function with corresponding CIV commands.
I think, that functions like display colors are not necessary to be remotely controlled by CIV.
But for conpleteness it is ok.

The memory hold some more paramters than frequency and mode. But with CIV transceive=1 only those are sent (and not all)
when changing the memory or vfo <-> memory.

Missing CIV codes:
I did not checked the IC705 systematically for missing CIV codes, but those I found:
gps alarm select
most picture functions (but not all of them make sense with rmote control)
1a04 is for agc mid only, fast and slow missing
wlan configuration
bluetooth configuration
