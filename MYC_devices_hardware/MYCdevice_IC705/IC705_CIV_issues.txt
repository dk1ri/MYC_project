ICOM CIV Issues and comments for IC705
20211207
Author: DK1RI

#######################################################
There is a new version of the CIV manual (Jan 2023)
This manual was not tested!!!!
#######################################################

Used IC705 firmware version: 1.26
CIV Manual Version: march 2021
IC705 converter programm (python) version: V01.5

My restrictions:
I use my IC705 at the current holiday qth in EA8 only. There I have written the CIV converter program.
I have basic DStar knowledge only. I used it a few times in DL with the IC9700.
There is no other DStar station nearby. I have no access to the internet router to install port forwarding.
So I did not found the reason for some of the coresponding command limitations.
Due to local limitations here I cannot use CIV and GPS at the same time.

Other general comments: see IC7300_CIV_issues.

Missing CIV codes:
I did not checked the IC705 systematically for missing CIV codes, but those I found:
gps alarm select
most picture functions (but not all of them make sense with remote control)
1a04 is for agc mid only, fast and slow missing
wlan configuration
bluetooth configuration
