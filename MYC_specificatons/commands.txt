This paper describes announcements and the command syntax and the format.
For usage, handling and environment for these commands in a MYC system see [1] and [2]

Definitions and formats

NO			normal device, device-type m
HI			human Interface  device, device-type h
CR			command-router, device-type c
LD			logic-device, device-type l
RU			rules device, device-type r
PR			controlled program with MYC Interface or interface to program, works similar to a normal device, device-type p.
PQ			controlling program, works similar to a HI, devicetype q
<dt>			devicetype: m, h, c, l,  r, p, q
<c>			unique (per device) command token; one number (unsigned 1, 2, 4 or 8 Byte). 0 (one byte always) is reserved for the basic
			announcement. &HxxF0 - &HxxFF are also reserved
<ct>			command-type
<p>			property (parameter) of the type <n> or <s> in command, answer and info 
<pa>			property of the type <n>, <ty>, <sm> or <OPTION> in an announcement 
<OPTION>		optional property
<des>	 		a string <sm>  used in announcements for identification or description of  commands and properties.
			<des> are optional sometimes. They can be used better human reading and for informative display of the HI. 
			They are also used for the translation to real values.
<n>			numeric value, binary in commands and properties; decimal readable in announcements, &Hxx, &Bxx notation allowed in 
			announcements. The transmitted values of numeric properties and data have a range from 0 to x, as defined by  the
 			announcement.
			For the selection of the property-format it is important, how many different values are needed. So a range of -3 to
			 +200 has 204 	values and a byte with the range of 0 to 203 is used. 
			A range from 1,0 to 2.0 needs 11 values from 0 to 10 – a byte is also sufficient.
			The HI knows the real values by the readable and real values of <des> of the announcement  and will translate and 
			display the real values.
			To minimize transmission time, numeric values for properties are transmitted 
			as byte, 				if equal or less than 255 (0 to &HFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned word (2 byte)		if equal or less than 65535 (0 - &HFFFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned long word (4 byte)	if up to 4 294 967 295  (0 - &HFFFFFFFF) different values are needed
			...
			For commandtoken the value is different, because there are 16 reserved token 
			All  numbers are “0” based.
<s>			string, all characters. The string is preceded by the length; as byte, word or long, depending on maximum length given in the 
			announcement. This type exists in commands answers and infos. For stringlength the rule of <n> apply.
<sm>			string (all characters except  , ;{}\) Used in announcements; forbidden characters must be escaped (preceded) by \
			if used as normal text.
<l>			maximum length of a string <s> in announcements
<ty>			1 byte: a : bit, b : byte; 2 bytes: i : signed integer, w : unsigned word; 4 bytes: e: signed long, L : unsigned long, s : single;
			8 bytes: d : double, t : time-date; variable bytes: c : command-token, 
 			<s> : string preceeded by actual length l. The length of l is defined by <l> in the announcement.
			t: the date format. The UNIX 64 bit format is used
			A bit is transferred as a byte with the value of &H00 or &H01
			If applicable data are transmitted “big endian”: MSB first
<default>		a default value in an announcement
<fixed>		a fixed informative value in an announcement
<announce>		complete announcement or announcement line, a string <sm>; as answer it is transmitted in <s> format
<data>			<s> or <n> in commands answers or info 
separators		For the announcement parser (CR, HI or LD eg):  , ; (comma, semicolon) 
			, is the separator between pa and des.
			; is the separator between pa
			There are no separators in commands, answers and infos
&HxxFF		means highest number in 1, 2, 4 or 8Byte number (hex format)
[ ]			optional properties

Announcements

The announcement uses a readable string in <sm> format. So the number of the command token is a readable figure, 1 eg for a hex &H01 command 
A complete announcement of a device consist of one line with the basic announcement, lines of command announcements, lines for the reserved tokens, and  lines of rules; in this sequence.
The basic announcement contains the description of the device. For details see [6]
The command announcements describe the commands the  device will understand.
Two of the reserved tokens are used by the CR to identify a device, also, if more than one of the same device-group (same hardware and firmware) exist. (&H00, &HxxFF)
The rules describe the conditions, when and how the commands will work for a device. Rules lines start with "R".
“Q” rules are send by the rulesdevices to the command-router and are not forwarded. They are used for user management.

Command-types without answer of the device are denoted by o (operate), with answer by a (answer) as the first letter. If a function can operate and answer, the descriptions in the other announcement should be identical. For example a memory, which can be written and read, must have the same unique description, to allow other devices to identify, that it is the same memory. Alternatively the description can be "as5" eg, where 5 is the command-token of the other command (see also announcement / command optimizing below).

In general a device interface is a very simple construction with limited communication bandwidth. So command communication should be simple and short, but announcements are communicated rarely or never, so they can be longer and descriptive in a readable format.
Announcements are stored in the devices, They are unique to a hardware / firmware combination and will never change. Therefore they can be stored also in a database or in the command-router.
The CR, LD and HI may find the details of the attached devices somewhere and probably will not ask the devices for detailed announcements or announcements at all.
The CR, LD and HI should be more "intelligent". They should be able to build up a complete MYC System by reading the announcements without operator interaction also in a varying environment. To ensure this, the description in the announcement should be sufficient and not too short. 
Obviously a command-router cannot poll for devices worldwide, so at initialization it must know a place, where all "its" possible devices are listed.
May be, that not all devices are active every time, but the CR, LD and HI must be able to handle this situation. So, the answer of a (announcement) &HxxF0 command to a command-router is not static.  It varies, when commands or devices disappear. Commands can also be active or disabled.

All devices must have announcements for the mandatory reserved commands. Additional announcements depend on the device.
All normal devices and controlled programs belongs to a unique devicegroup. This devicegroup has a unique name and has a not changeable set of commands and firmware.
How announcements can be called by the commands &H00 and  &HxxF0 is described in [6]

General syntax for a command-announcement

<c>;<ct>[,<des>]...[,<des>][<;pa>[,<des>]..[,<des>]]...[;<pa>[,<des>]... [,<des>]]

Commands and properties

The command tokens use numeric byte, word or long format.  The shortest format possible is always used.
For properties the same  rules apply. For memory type commands a string and time format is allowed as property as well.
So if a device has less than 239 (0, 240- 255 is reserved) commands, the communication with the CR use byte format for the command token. If the CR knows more for the different devices, it may communicate with the HI with words (2 bytes). or long (4 bytes). In this case, the first byte of translated command-tokens must not be 0 (but can be 1), because one byte &H00 is reserved for the basic announcement.
Shortest possible format is used for properties as well. The command-router and the devices know the format by the announcement.
A command consist of a command-token and properties (parameters) depending on the command-type.
The number and type of the properties of a command must match the announcement. If the announcement describe a min and max property and unit, the command will obviously have one property only for the value. For details see List of Standardized Command-types below.
Each command belongs to a standardized command-type. There are w and i command-types for metacommands, operate (o) command-types, answer (a) command-types, "require to operate" (r)  command-types and “require to answer” (s) command-types. The announcement for r and s command-types is identical to the o and a command-type and therefore not mentioned in the list below. These are used by PQ and HI to denote what they want to sent in addition to the commands they get from the CR. The LD must find a translation of these other commands or block them. Therefore r and s commands are forwarded to the LD only.
Each standardized command-type denotes a general function like os for operate a switch and defines the number and type of the properties. From this other devices will know the details of the devices function and the length of a command. The list below show the announcement templates, corresponding command, answer and info for the command-types.
In some cases, different command-types can be chosen for a command. A frequency control will obviously get a range op type, because it covers a range of values, which can be easily defined with a min and max value. But what about an address ranging from 1  to 10? This can also be realized as a switch with 10 positions or a range type command. The command will act identical; the display on the HI may be different. If the real values are not a range  or each position has an individual label the switch must be used in any case.
A rule of thumb is, that the range, p command-type will be used, if there are "many" equal distance values in a range.
Optional properties are defined for some command-types and are optional for an announcement. If they are defined in an announcement, they must be given in a command. 

There is no rule for devices for the numbering of the command-token, but simple sequenced numbering is recommended. The CR will put  the command-tokens of the known individual devices together, so that all commands are sequenced with translated command-tokens in the same order as the original announcement lines. The new command-tokens start with &H01 (&H0100, &H01000000, (no "0" as first byte) or higher in a simple sequence without gaps. There may be gaps in the list, if a known device disappears. 
The CR will not forward announcement commands (&Hxx240) but answer them with its own command.
The CR will also not forward Individualization commands.
A announcelist from a lower level CR will have the own announcements at the beginning (basic announcement) and the end. The CR will not put these together, so that the hierarchical structure is visible.
The reserved tokens of the individual devices – if forwarded -are translated by the CR as well; the own (reserved) tokens of the CR are &HxxF0 ...
Devices as PQ and HI, which can send commands must send their own infos with translated tokens. Otherwise the command-router cannot identify them.
The CR will translate the inline command-tokens of the content of commands and announcements as well.

General syntax for a command

<c>[<p>]...[<p>]

Info

Some  command-types can send answers without a command as info. It is not mandatory, that a device must send infos; a I2C slave will never do.
The CR translates the infos tokens if necessary. It sends all translated infos of normal devices to the logic device. A normal device do not have the knowledge of the other connected device; so the format is <command><answer.>. Other devices can send some infos also to single devices, lists or all. So the format is <command><destination><answer>. Using this method a info of a normal device can be sent to single devices.
Infos are not sent to normal devices. Other devices get infos when they are not waiting for answers.
PQ and HI send translated infos.

General syntax for info

<c>[<p>]...[<p>] 			for normal devices.
<c><destination>[<p>]...		for some metacommands, <destination is the commandtoken of the basic announcement of the device  or a list 

Announcement / Command optimizing

The following optimizations may be used by all devices. The CR will only resolve the long announcement line to one and copy the "as" line. The CR will translate commandtoken sent with announcements.
The LD and the HI and PQ should understand the optimizations.

Long announcement lines
If a announcement is too long to fit in one line more lines can be used. The command-token must be the same.
So
	11;aa,Control;a,Preset;a,Motor_cw;a,Motor_ccw;
	11;aa;a,Limit;a,Underlimit;a,Overlimit
is the same as
	11;aa,Control;a,Preset;a,Motor_cw;a,Motor_ccw;a,Limit;a,Underlimit;a,Overlimit
The CR simply paste the lines together omitting commandtoken and commandtype of the second line. Take care on the “;” of the first line.

Save space in announcements
If  a function can operate and answer, one announcement can be simplified:
	5;op,Rotatoroffset;1;361
	6;ap,as5
will be resolved by the CR to
	6;ap,Rotatoroffset;1;361

Optimize command transmission 
If a command should be very short and a parameter should be part of the command-token, the following can be used
Instead of  a the two byte command
	2;os;0,manual;1,preset
you use 2 one byte command-token
	2;os;0,manual
	3;os,ext2;1,preset			ext as extend. The extend is an information for HI and PQ, that it is one switch

different method
Some functions can be accessed with different methods. A oscillator can be controlled with a value (by memory or knob) or as scan function
2,op,VFOA;30000 ,{3500000 to 3800000};lin;Hz
3,oo,ext2;255;1;255;1;250;down
4,oo,ext2;255;1;255;100;100;up				fixed stepsize for scanning, stepsize will be omitted in the command 

List of Standardized Command-types

These command-type templates contain a description or format of  the properties, where necessary. For most properties the type, shortest numeric or string is obvious. In some cases the type must be defined.

Meta-commands
Meta commands are used to control the system, they do not initiate actions.

commands, which denote, which commands are enabled / disabled :
At start all commands are enabled. The following commands are used eg, when some devices or commands are not used or should not be used at a specific time 
The "o'x'“/”a'x'" commandtypes are used, to switch a part of a device. The status can be sent as info to all.
These commands are a special form of a switch: commands are enabled (switches on) or disabled (switched off). Disabled commands are ignored.
A device must have the commandtoken mentioned in these commands.
The command-router will translate these inline commandtoken and will delete inconsistent commands.

Operating commands:
announce:	<c>;oc[,<des>]...[,<des>];max_number_of_token			enable (0) / disable (1) variable list of commands
command:	<d>0|1<s>								<s> is a string of <c>; <c> may be a hierarchical list of <c>

announce:	<c>;od[,<des>]...[,<des>];<c><,des>;...<c><,des>			enable / disable a fixed list of command-tokens 
command:	<c>0|1

answer commands
announce:	<c>;ac[,<des>]...[,<des>];max_number_of_token			show: commands are enabled / disabled
command:	<c><s>								<s> list  of commands
answer:	<s>									list of 0|1
info:		<c>0|1<s> 								all commands, which are enabled /disabled
announce:	<c>;ad[,<des>]...[,<des>];<c><,des>;...<c><,des>			show: a fixed list of command-tokens is  enabled /disabled
command:	<c>
answer:	<0|1										
info:		<c><0|1>

info commands:
These commandtypes have  info only. Usually the LD or RU and controlling devices define and send these info to other controlling devices. The commands are used to inform controlling devices like PQ or HI, that they are not allowed to send specific commands. These commands are not used by devices, which are controlled only. The commands use “actual” (translated) commandtoken only.
These “i'x'” commands have two strings as parameters:
The first parameter is a string <s> with the commandtoken of the basic announcements of those devices the list should be sent to or for those the command is valid. A "xx0" is used to send to all.  The CR strips this parameter and send the second to the affected devices only.
The second parameter is a string of a list of commands, if applicable.

announce:	<c>;ic[,<des>]...[,<des>];max_number_of_addresses<,des>;max_number_of_token<,des>
											enable (0) or disable (1) variable list of commands

one dimensional form for  potentiometer, frequency generator ...
two dimensional form for joysticks...
three dimensional form for robotics...
<number_of_valuesx> are byte, word or long, not single or double. To display real values with "." see “More about Descriptions”

												lin|log: real values in <des> linear or logarithmic
												more number_of_values blocks means more than one 													dimension 
command:	<c><n>									go to n

comments: The userinterface calculate the real stepsize using the <des> (3500000 to 3800000 + 7000000 to 7100000 eg /  by number_of_values.
The userinterface decides, how accurate the display is. 
If the displayed step would vary with ranges, a additional announcement with ext option can be used.

info:		<c><n>									one dimensional

Command has a data destination like memory, data channel or text field

It is not intended to replace data streams with these command, but it is not defined clearly, where simple data transmission ends and streaming is starting.
There is no “undefined” value, when reading a memory. Therefore a FIFO  should not be read if not known whether the data is valid. The device should send the data by info or support a memory with the number of available data.
The content of the memory has the full range of the defined properties: so “0” as first byte is allowed as answer. The position of the memory cell is “0” based as well.

More about Descriptions

The description should help the HI to find the correct parameters and to do the correct user readable labeling. If there is no description the HI will use the full range as defined by the property type and the labeling will be accordingly.
It can also be used to limit the range of allowed values. Hex Values as &H00 to &H7F are allowed.
The first “part” within the description is used for this; additional description separated by “,” may follow.
The following rules apply for the three types of commands:
Descriptions for switches:
Usually any button of switches has a label. So the first value of the description is used as label. Others, separated by ”,” may follow.

Descriptions for range commands:
To separate the labeling from the other description bracket {} are used.
The number of values is given by the properties. So this labeling information is  necessary only, if the real and transmitted values are different.
999,{1 to 999}			transmitted as 0 to 998
1000,{1.0 to 99.9}			transmitted as 0 to 999
4,{1,3,4,5}				transmitted as 0 to 3
401,{1 to 99, 200 to 500}		transmitted as 0 to 400  (2 byte)

Descriptions for memory type commands:
There are three optional kinds of descriptions. 
The first describe the real values of memory positions for the om, on, am, an commands only, if real values and transmitted values are different. This description come with the row / column property. The transmitted values have the range 0 to x (as given by this type of description), The labeling can use the labels for rows, columns...
This description is enclosed by {}.
If the number of <pa> do not match the <des>, the HI will try some rounding (defined by the HI). This is not recommended.
The following is allowed:
{1,2,3}		value 0,1,2 are the real values for 1, 2,3 (3 element memory)
{a,b,d}			a, b, d are real values for 0, 1, 2. (3 element memory)
{1.0 to 3.0}		real values are 1.0, 1,1... 3.0 for 0 … 20
{1 to 999}		real values 1 to 999 for 0 to 998
row: {1,2} col: {3,4}	the label for &H01 could be “2 3”, for &H04: “2 4”

The second type of description describe the allowed values of data and come as first description with <ty>. This is a restriction of the full range of <ty>. For string type values, it is a restriction of the allowed values, others are transferred “0” based; so it may be a restriction and translation.
In other words: if you want to avoid a translation, you must use a string type. 
This type of description is enclosed by {}
2,{a,c,d}		string of 2 characters; this limits the allowed characters, others will be ignored by the device.
2,{a to z,A to Z}	string of 2 characters; letters only allowed
b,{a,c,d}		byte; stored and transmitted as 0,1,2 Others will be ignored.
w,{0 to 100.0}		word (2 bytes); 0 to 100.0 only, transmitted as 0 to 1000, other numbers are ignored.
The device will ignore commands with values out of range and may produce an error message.

The third type of description separated by “,” can give additional information for the HI.

More about Properties

Positional properties and numeric data are transferred as binary values; lowest value is 0 always.
Because the commandrouter will have to poll some devices, which cannot send answers or info by themselves (with I2C interface eg), the CR must have a indication weather the read data are valid or not. This can be done by the parameter ANSWERTIME of the &HxxFA command. If not given, the time is 100ms. The CR will wait for this time, before reading data. Another method to solve this is to use ADDFF or ADD0. For details see [6].
