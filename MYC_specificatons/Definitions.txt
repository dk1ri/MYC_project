Introduction

This paper describes the definitions and abbreviations and formats used in the MYC documentation.
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.

Definitions, abbreviations  and formats

FU			func, function, normal device or controlled program, device-type m
SK			skin, human Interface or controlling program, device-type h
CR			command-router, device-type c
LD			logic-device, device-type l
RU			rules device, device-type r
<dt>			devicetype: m, h, c, l,  r
<dg>			device-group; devices with identical hardware and firmware
<c>			unique (per device) command token; one number (unsigned 1, 2, 4 or 8 Byte). 0 (one byte always) is reserved for the basic
			announcement. &HxxF0 - &HxxFF are also reserved
<ct>			command-type
<p>			property (parameter) of the type <n> or <s> in command, answer and info 
<pa>			property of the type <n>, <ty>, <sm> or <OPTION> in an announcement 
<OPTION>		optional property
<DEFAULT>		mandatory default value
<des>	 		a string <sm>  used in announcements for identification or description of  commands and properties.
			<des> are optional sometimes. They can be used better human reading and for informative display of the SK. 
			They are also used for the translation to real values or restriction of values.
<n>			numeric value, binary in commands and properties; decimal readable in announcements, &Hxx, &Bxx notation allowed in 
			announcements. The transmitted values of numeric properties and data have a range from 0 to x, as defined by  the
 			announcement.
			For the selection of the property-format it is important, how many different values are needed. So a (real) range of -3 to
			 +200 has 204 	values and a byte with the range of 0 to 203 is used for transmission.
			A range from 1,0 to 2.0 needs 11 values from 0 to 10 – a byte is also sufficient.
			The SK knows the real values by the readable and real values of <des> of the announcement  and will translate and 
			display the real values.
			To minimize transmission time, numeric values for properties are transmitted 
			as byte, 				if equal or less than 255 (0 to &HFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned word (2 byte)		if equal or less than 65535 (0 - &HFFFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned long word (4 byte)	if up to 4 294 967 295  (0 - &HFFFFFFFF) different values are needed
			...
			For command-token the value is different, because there are 16 reserved token 
			All transmitted numbers are “0” based.
<s>			string, all characters. The string is preceded by the length; as byte, word or long, depending on maximum length given in the 
			announcement. This type exists in commands, answers and infos. For stringlength the rule of <n> apply.
<sm>			string (all characters except  , ;{}\) Used in announcements; forbidden characters must be escaped (preceded) by \
			if used as normal text.
<l>			maximum length of a string <s> in announcements
<ty>			0 byte: z: no data transfer / use internal data; 1 byte: a : bit, b : byte; 2 bytes: i : signed integer, w : unsigned word; 
			4 bytes: e: signed long, L : unsigned long, s : single;
			8 bytes: d : double, t : time-date; variable number of bytes: c : command-token, 
 			<s> : string preceeded by actual length l. The length of l is defined by <l> in the announcement.
			t: the date format. The UNIX 64 bit format is used
			A bit is transferred as a byte with the value of &H00 or &H01
			The 0 byte notifier is used when internal data are used
			All data are transmitted “big endian”: MSB first
<default>		a default value in an announcement (not mandatory)
<fixed>		a fixed informative value in an announcement
<announce>		complete announcement or announcement line, a string <sm>; as answer it is transmitted in <s> format
<data>			<s> or <n> in commands answers or info 
separators		For the announcement parser (CR, HI or LD eg):  , ; (comma, semicolon) 
			, is the separator between pa and des.
			; is the separator between pa
			There are no separators in commands, answers and infos
&HxxFF		means highest number in 1, 2, 4 or 8Byte number (hex format)
[ ]			optional properties

Non valid data

There is no character reserved for non valid data.
Any device must answer with valid data. In some cases a device is polled for data, but data may be not valid at that time. The default polling wait time for the caller is 100ms. The device can modify it by the &HxxFA announcement. After that time data must be valid.
If  for any reason this cannot be used, the device will send the requested number of &H00. For the real answer “0” it will send &HFF&H00 and for a “&HFF” a &HFF&HFF.  &HFF is the escape character. This is behavior is announced by the &xxHFA  announcement.
Using other escape characters will work similar.
