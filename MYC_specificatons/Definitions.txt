Introduction

This paper describes the definitions and abbreviations and formats used in the MYC documentation.
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.

Definitions, abbreviations  and formats


FU			func, function, normal device or controlled program, device-type m
SK			skin, human Interface or controlling program, device-type h
SS			simple skin as switches, send r / s commands only, device-type s, o / a commands are used during configuration; not for new 
			designs
CR			command-router, device-type c
LD			logic-device, device-type l
RU			rules device, device-type r
<dt>			devicetype: m, h, c, l,  r; s not for new designs
<dg>			device-group; devices with identical hardware and firmware
<c>			unique (per device) command token; one number (unsigned n bytes). 0 (one byte always) is reserved for the basic 
			announcement. 0xxxf0 - 0xxxff are also reserved 
<ct>			command-type
<p>			property (parameter) of the type <n> or <s> in command, answer and info 
<pa>			property of the type <n>, <ty>, <sm> or <OPTION> in an announcement 
<OPTION>		optional property
<DEFAULT>		mandatory default value
<des>	 		a string <sm>  used in announcements for identification or description of  commands and properties.
			<des> are optional sometimes. They can be used better human reading and for informative display of the SK. 
			They are also used for the translation to real values or restriction of values. 
<n>			numeric value, binary in commands and properties; decimal readable in announcements, 0xxx, 0bxx notation allowed in 
			announcements. This notation is translated by the CR, when creating the full list, but not in <des>.This notation is not allowed in 
			“” and “I” lines.
			Numbers are transmitted “big endian”: MSB first. 
			<n> has different environments:
			- <n> is used as a positional parameter as unsigned numbers for switches, range control and position of memory cells. The
			transmitted values have a range from 0 to x, as defined by  the announcement.
			For the selection of these numbers it is important, how many different values are needed. So a (real) range of -3 to
			+200 has 204 values and a byte with the range of 0 to 203 is used for transmission.
			A range from 1,0 to 2.0 needs 11 values from 0 to 10 – a byte is also sufficient. 
			The SK knows the real values by the readable and real values of <des> of the announcement  and will translate and 
			display the real values. 
			To minimize transmission time, numeric values for properties are transmitted 
			as 1 byte, if equal or less than 255 (0 to 0xff) different values are needed 
			as 2 bytes, if equal or less than 65535 (0 - 0xffff) different values are needed 
			as 3 bytes,... …
			 All transmitted numbers are “0” based. 
			In  on / an, of / af and ob and ab command a “0” of number of elements mean no element.
			- For command-token the same rule apply; but the 16 token for reserved commands must be taken into account. For the full list
     			of the CR there are additional 16 token for communication with SK reserved.
			– The length of the transmitted number of numeric memory-contents is defined by <ty> 
<s>			string, all characters. The string is preceded by the length as unsigned number. The length is of type <n> and can 1, 2, 3..byte; 
			depend on maximum length of thr string given in the announcement. This type exists in commands, answers and infos.
<sm>			string (all characters except  , ;{}\) Used in announcements; forbidden characters must be escaped (preceded) by \
<l>			maximum length of a string <s> in announcements
<ty>			 type of memory cells in announcements, signed use 2-complement representation
			0 byte: z: no data transfer / use internal data;
			1 byte: a: bit 0|1, b: byte, 0to255; c: signed short, -128to127
			2 bytes: i: signed integer,-32768to327687;  w: unsigned integer, 0to65535
			4 bytes: e: signed long, -2147483648to2147483647; L: unsigned long, 0to4294967295; s: single;
			8 bytes: d : double, t : (64 bit UNIX) time-date
			variable number of bytes: c : command-token. 
 			<l> : maximum length of a string.
			A bit is transferred as a byte with the value of 0x00 or 0x01.
			The 0 byte type z is used when internal data are used.
<default>		a default value in an announcement (not mandatory)
<fixed>		a fixed informative value in an announcement
<announce>		complete announcement or announcement line, a string <sm>; as answer it is transmitted in <s> format
<data>			<s> or <n> in commands answers or info 
separators		For the announcement parser (CR, SK or LD eg):  , ; (comma, semicolon) 
			, is the separator between pa and des.
			; is the separator between <c>, <ct> and <pa> 
			There are no separators in commands, answers and infos
0xxxff			means highest number in 1, 2, 3..Byte number (hex format) (not used in announcements)
[ ]			optional properties

All numbers in announcements are numeric; hex format 0xnn is allowed but not yet supported by the CR.

Non valid data

There is no character reserved for non valid data.
Any device must answer with valid data. In some cases a device is polled for data, but data may be not valid at that time. The default polling wait time for the caller is 100ms. If a device do not have valid data, it will send a not valid command-token.
