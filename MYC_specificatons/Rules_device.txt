Introduction

This paper describes some ideas for the rules-device For more details of the MYC system please check the reference. There is no program for this up to now!

Some explanation 

For details of rules see [6]. The Rules-device should do the following: 
- Provide “R”-rules for dependencies between different devices. The rules may created via an
	appropriate user interface.
- Create “R” rules for system wide commands.
- Provide a user management: create “Q” rules.

For simplicity of usage and editing the internal storage of the rules-device uses “full commands” for “R” rules. These “full commands” consist of the I-line of the device and the relative count of the commandtoken within the device for reference to a commandtoken. These command are created from the full announcelist from the CR. So commands can be identified even if command-token numbering changes. If a rule should be sent to the CR, the RU translates the full commands to the original translated command-token.

“R” rules
 “R” rules describe the dependencies between different devices and system wide commands. “R” rules for CR, RU, LD or SK are not allowed.

“Q” rules 
Q rules are used for user management. 
As default the command-router allow all commands for all users, but this can be changed to forbid users to send commands to specific devices or to send specific commands. This is done by “Q” rules.
The access to the RU device is handled in the same way as for other devices: users can use the commands or it is forbidden.
The RU itself is a device with few commands. These commands are part of the full announcelist. So the SK can use them.
By default the RU has one admin account with password, which can be changed. This login is needed to use all commands of the RU.
How the “Q” rules affect the access to commands is described in [6]

RU announcemnts
The command to write or overwrite “R” rules:
1;om,”R” rules;500;1000.
This allow up to 1000 rules while a length < 500 (can be changed)

The read command (these rule may be not those the CR is using):
2;am,as1

as command 1 but for “Q” rules
3;om,”Q” rules;500;1000.
This allow up to 1000 rules while a length < 500 (can be changed)

The read command (these rule may be not those the CR is using):
4;am,as3

This command will send „all“ rules to the CR. The CR will know by the name “FOR_CR” that it should read the rules and will not forward them.
5;am,FOR_CR;1;0,idle;1,send to CR

allow a user to create “R” rules with a commandtoken as “left_side” commandtoken (admin only). If the commandtoken is the basic command of a device, all commands of the device are allowed. A *” means: all devices (admin only):
6;ob,<des>;<s>,username;<n>commandtoken

as above, but disallow user (admin only):
7;ob,<des>;<s>,username;<n>commandtoken

allow a user to create “Q” rules (admin only):
8;ob,<des>;<s>,username;<n>commandtoken

as above, but disallow user (admin only):
9;ob,<des>;<s>,username;<n>commandtoken

add a user account for login (admin only):
10;ob,<des>;<s>,name;<s>,password

delete a user account for login (admin only):
11;ob,<des>;<s>,name

read all usernames; usernames are limited to 100 characters and max 1000 users ((admin only):
12;an,usernames;100,1000

change account and password for the admin user:
13:1;ob,<des>;b,mode;<s>,old_name;<s>,old_password;<s>new_name;<s>,new_password

reply to CR, weather a login was ok or not (will send “0” or “1” as info)
14;aa,LOGIN_DATA;b

Login command:
2511;ob,LOGON;b,mode;<s>,name;<s>,password

For details of the login command see http://dk1ri.de/myc/Reserved_tokens.pdf.

User management may be done via a more comfortable GUI other than the existing GUI using the webserver.
