Introduction

This paper describes the usage of the MYC protocol in a KI system
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.
This paper describes some ideas only.

Some explanation

The MYC protocol is a OSI layer 6 / 7 protocol. It is a semantic protocol.
But within this there are different levels.
A KI (artificial intelligence) system requires a very exact definition of input / output. If a KI system should do a task, it must know, which devices it must use and which commands to operate.
A housekeeping system must find environment sensor by itself, find the correct command to read the temperature and interpret the answer.
So the environment sensor must deliver the necessary data by its introduction (announcement) in a general standardized way.
The MYC protocol provide these announcements, but the labels are not standardized yet.
A individual description is possible with the 0xxxfe /0xxxff command but this may be not sufficient. So a additional reserved command may be used   in future.  

The MYC protocol do a abstraction of the real semantic of a command to simple command-types like switch, range control and memory commands. This drastically reduces the transmission bandwidth and is sufficient in a M2M (machine to machine) environment. But the details of the reality must be given by the announcements.

Result

It is necessary to standardize the labels in the announcement in a early stage.
