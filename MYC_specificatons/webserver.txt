Status

Apache webserver on Raspberrrey set up
Basics of website started

Some explanation

This webserver can use all function delivered by the system via the full announce-list.
The webserver read the announcelist andcreate a page . Each commandtype will produce a specific default input or output field, which depends on the parameters as well.
The user calls his own individual web site and get his personal web layout.
Because functions may disappear when a device disappears, the page will be completely dynamic. The labels of those functions may disappear or be grayed out.
The user should find a knob to switch to an edit mode.
In this mode the web page behaves like a web editor. The user can modify those functions defined by the full announcement-list. The result is stored in a user individual config file or data base.
For simple usage preconfigured files (skins) can be used.
For normal mode the web-server build the page by using the config file and the announce-list.

In a next step the user wil be able to modify the page by creating a personal configfile. 
So the user can define his own colors and view of the funtions in a edit mode and use it later on.
