This paper describes reserved command tokens.
For usage, handling of commands see also [1] and [2]

Definitions and formats

NO			normal device, device-type m
HI			human Interface  device, device-type h
CR			command-router, device-type c
LD			logic-device, device-type l
RU			rules device, device-type r
PR			controlled program with MYC Interface or interface to program, works similar to a normal device, device-type p.
PQ			controlling program, works similar to a HI, devicetype q
<dt>			devicetype: m, h, c, l,  r, p, q
<c>			unique (per device) command token; one number (unsigned 1, 2, 4 or 8 Byte). 0 (one byte always) is reserved for the basic
			announcement. &HxxF0 - &HxxFF are also reserved
<ct>			command-type
<p>			property (parameter) of the type <n> or <s> in command answer and info 
<pa>			property of the type <n>, <ty>, <sm> or <OPTION> in an announcement 
<OPTION>		optional property
<des>	 		a string <sm>  used in announcements for identification or description of  commands and properties.
			<des> are optional sometimes. They can be used better human reading and for informative display of the HI. 
			They are also used for the translation to real values.
<n>			numeric value, binary in commands and properties; decimal readable in announcements, &Hxx, &Bxx notation allowed in 
			announcements. The transmitted values of numeric properties and data have a range from 0 to x, as defined by  the
 			announcement.
			For the selection of the property-format it is important, how many different values are needed. So a range of -3 to
			 +200 has 204 	values and a byte with the range of 0 to 203 is used. 
			A range from 1,0 to 2.0 needs 11 values from 0 to 10 – a byte is also sufficient.
			The HI knows the real values by the readable and real values of <des> of the announcement  and will translate and 
			display the real values.
			To minimize transmission time, numeric values for properties are transmitted 
			as byte, 				if equal or less than 255 (0 to &HFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned word (2 byte)		if equal or less than 65535 (0 - &HFFFF) different values are needed 
			as unsigned long word (4 byte)	if up to 4 294 967 295 (0 - &HFFFFFFFF) different values are needed
			...
			For commandtoken the value is different, because there are 16 reserved token 
			All  numbers are “0” based.
<s>			string, all characters. The string is preceded by the length; as byte, word or long, depending on maximum length given in the 
			announcement. This type exists in commands answers and infos. For stringlength the rule of <n> apply.  
<sm>			string (all characters except  , ;{}\) Used in announcements; forbidden characters must be escaped (preceded) by \
			if used as normal text.
<l>			maximum length of a string <s> in announcements
<ty>			1 byte: a : bit, b : byte; 2 bytes: i : signed integer, w : unsigned word; 4 bytes: e: signed long, L : unsigned long, s : single;
			8 bytes: d : double, t : time-date; variable bytes: c : command-token, 
 			<s> : string preceeded by actual length l. The length of l is defined by <l> in the announcement.
			t: the date format. The UNIX 64 bit format is used
			A bit is transferred as a byte with the value of &H00 or &H01
			If applicable data are transmitted “big endian”: MSB first
<default>		a default value in an announcement
<fixed>		a fixed informative value in an announcement
<announce>		complete announcement or announcement line, a string <sm>; as answer it is transmitted in <s> format
<data>			<s> or <n> in commands answers or info 
separators		For the announcement parser (CR, HI or LD eg):  , ; (comma, semicolon) 
			, is the separator between pa and des.
			; is the separator between pa
			There are no separators in commands, answers and infos
&HxxFF		means highest number in 1, 2, 4 or 8Byte number (hex format)
[ ]			optional properties

Overview

Every MYC device should provide mandatory reserved command tokens and understand them, if applicable.
The set of announcements of a MYC device should start with the basic command &H00 and end with the individualization command &HxxFF as last command. This is necessary, to identify commands in systems with hierarchical (stacked) commandrouters. Rules lines may follow only.
Reserved tokens are  (one byte) &H00 and &HxxF0 - &HxxFF.
Reserved one byte token &H00 must be the first token of the announcelist; the other reserved token must be at the end in the numerical sequence.

Eight of these are used and defined now: &H00, &HxxF0, &HxxF1 and &HxxFA - &HxxFF

Announcements Command &H00, &HxxF0 and &HxxF1

All MYC devices should have the commands &H00 and &HxxF0 .

&H00 basic announcement:
The basic announcement is called with the one byte command &H00.
announce:	0;<dt>;MANUFACTURER;DEVICEDESCRIPTION;VERSION;NUMBER_OF_DEVICE;LINELENGTH; NUMBER_OF_COMMANDLINES;NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES

command:	&H00
answer:	<basic announcement>		as string <s>				
info:		-

There is no info. The device can use the &HxxF0 info instead.
The announcement is fixed and therefore format description is not transmitted. Instead the line with content is transmitted.
The first byte of the answer  is the one byte string-length. The &H00 announcement is limited therefore to 255 Bytes.
The CR can check with the &H00 command, whether a controlled device is active.
The CR will send the &H00 command to controlling devices as HI, PQ.. to inform them about a new list of announcements.. The answer must be a valid string.


Device with <dt> are sending commandtoken as per the following list, all communication is via CR:

		<dt> 
                        |                                              sending commands T: translated; N: not translated; -: not sending

MANUFACTURER DEVICEDESCRIPTION and VERSION are combined to a devicegroupname and are used in file names, so not all character are allowed. Preferred is a-z, A-Z, 0-9 _		
These devicegroupnames are unique to a  normal device and its firmware. A (published) device / firmware combination with a devicegroupname must not be changed. If changes are necessary, a new version must be used. Each device with it individualization belongs to a devicegroup. So, this is valid also for controlled programs, but not for controlled CR and controlling devices.
For a normal device  NUMBER_OF_DEVICES is 1, This value (all active devices) is important for the command-router as info for a 
higher level CR
LINELENGTH is the maximum linelength of the announcement lines.
NUMBER_OF_COMMANDLINES is the number of command lines including the basic announcement &H00 but without the rules and reserved commands of the actual device. Using this number the requesting device will calculate the number of bytes used for the commandtoken.
NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES includes rules and all reserved commands. This is necessary to find the type of parameter for a announcement command. When the number of devices changes for a CR, it informs HI etc about a new announcelist. The HI send &H00 and from the NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES it known, how many bytes the parameters in the command &HxxF0 must have.

&HxxF0:
announce:	240;an,ANNOUNCEMENTS,<des>...<des>;<l>;<NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES>	240 for 1 byte command-token
command:	&HxxF0<n><m>											ask for m announcement lines starting at 
															position n
answer:	<s>[<s>...]
info:		&HxxF0<announce line 0>

<n> is a positional parameter of the memory, the commandtoken of the answer may be different. The number of bytes for <m> and <n> depends on <NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES>.
<l> is the same as for the basic announcement; it is the maximum length of the string of the memory.  The number of bytes for the string-length 
	depends on this.
< NUMBER_OF_ANNOUNCELINES> is the number of the announcement lines including those for the reserved commands and rules.

The commandrouter will drop the  ANNOUNCEMENTS lines of the other devices when building the complete list. The command-router answers all announcement commands by itself. So the asking devices as HI and PQ will have all correct (translated) command-token. The commandrouter can  send the &HxxF0 command to devices and will get an answer. The commandrouter will  not forward &HxxF0 infos.

Devices may be added or may disappear. It is assumed, that this will rarely happen, so that the CR will build a new list in this case and distribute it.
The CR will not necessarily renumber the commandtoken.
Future versions of the CR may use metacommands to handle disappeared devices.

&HF1:
announce:	241;an,BASIC ANNOUNCEMENTS,<des>...<des>;<n>						241 for 1 byte command-token
command:	&HxxF0<n><m>											ask for basic m announcement lines
															start at n (“0” based)
answer:	<s>
info:		&HxxF1<basic announcelines>

This command is for the CR only.

Features &HxxFA

This is not a command but a description announcement of optional additional feature and properties of a device, which cannot be modified.
This line is optional and not forwarded by the CR, if not necessary.
Defined features are:
ANSWERTIME<n>	Time (ms) for the CR to wait before asking for an answer, if the CR must poll for a answer (for I2C eg). If applicable but not 
			given the default ANSWERTIME is 100ms. Not forwarded.
ADDFF,<c>,<des>,<c>..	The device add a $HFF at the beginning of a answer of <c>. When the CR polls for an answer of command <c>, it will
			get not valid data. Valid data start with a &HFF. Used for all answer commands, if <c> is 0 (basic announcement). 
			Additional <des> must not be numeric. Not forwarded.
ADD0,<c>,<des>,<c>..	same as above, but valid data start with &H00.  Not forwarded.

Log on Command &HxxFB

This command is used by the commandrouter and rules-device only. If the system requires a log on for users to allow all or a subset of commands the user  will be able to see the local commands of the commandrouter and only the local subset of the &HxxF0 command.  The log on command is sent to the rulesdevice, which will then send  a set of “Q” rules to the LD
announce:	251;ob,LOGON[,<des>];<b>,mode;<s>,name;<s>,password
mode:	1	log out
	2	log on
	3	switch on user management (admin only)
	4	switch off user management (admin only)
command:	&HxxFB<n><m><mode><name><password>
answer		-
info		-

Last Error Command &HxxFC

This command is mandatory and delivers the last error the device detected. 
The command announcement has the first description  "LAST ERROR" to identify them in a list with the translated command-token, which is sent by the command-router.
announce:	252;aa,LAST ERROR[,<des>];<s><,des>
command	&HxxFC
answer		<s>
The format of the string is not defined. It should be used for debugging

Info Command &HxxFD

These info command deliver variable data. This 
These devices can store infos in a info buffer and the command-router can poll with the info command.
Multiple <OPTION> are addressed by position.
The command announcement has the first description  "MYC INFO" to identify them in a list with the translated command-token, which is sent by the command-router.

announce:	253;aa,MYC INFO[,<des>]...[,<des>];<ty>,<OPTION>,[<des>..][...}
command:	&HxxFD
Answer	<s>|<n>	
info:		253<m><s>|<n>		send info of position m

<OPTION>			Values:
b,ACTIVE					mandatory
				03		busy
				04		ready and active
				other <n>	try again in <n> seconds	
b,ANNOUNCELIST		<n>		(new) list <n> available; for CR only
				
more  to be defined

Individualization Commands &HxxFE and &HxxFF

The individualization commands write and read the individual properties of a device as names and number for different devices of the same devicegroup in a system and also properties of the communication with the command-router.
The &HxxFF is mandatory as last command of a set of announcements. Rules lines may follow only.
The command announcements have the first description  "INDIVIDUALISATION to identify them in a list with the translated command-token, which is sent by the command-router.

These properties usually are not written during normal usage but can be written for individualization before the normal usage.
It is not necessary that all of the readable properties  are writable as well.
At start up the CR must know the individual communication properties for the devices, which therefore must be stored locally,  if the device cannot send them by info (in an I2C environment eg).

announce:	254;oa,INDIVIDUALISATION[,des];<ty>,<OPTION>,<DEFAULT>[,<des>]..	
command	254<n><data>							<n> is the sequence number of the OPTION (0 based)
answer		-
info:		-
announce:	255;aa,INDIVIDUALISATION[,des];<ty>,<OPTION>,<DEFAULT>[,<des>]..	
command	255<n>								<n> is the sequence number of the OPTION (0 based))
answer		<data>
info:		255<data><data>							all parameters

The following is a list of defined device-properties and values; This list is not complete; updates will follow.
For multiple interfaces OPTIONs for each interface must be grouped together and start with the interfacetype as USB, TELNET,....
A <DEFAULT> is mandatory where specified. These interfaces are the “listen” interface, where commands are accepted.
A device with multiple interfaces can have not all interfaces activ, depending on hardware variants with the same firmware. This will be defined by a bit during individualization: 0: not active; 1: active. A device must ignore inputs from deactivated interfaces. If all interfaces are deactivated, activation can be done on any possible interface. No rule is needed for this behaviour.

OPTION>							comment:
<l>,NAME,<defaultname>					actual name, mandatory write/read; < 256 characters
<n>,NUMBER,<defaultnumber>				actual number, mandatory write/read
<l>,I2C|RS232|CAN|RC5|RC6| 				This INTERFACETYPE is for information only
USB|TELNET|HTTP|HTTPS|TERMINAL|			Multiple interfaces start with one of these types, followed by the other parameters.
SSH|RADIO,<active>					Type + parameters must be unique for a device.

Defined Interfaces:

 <l>,I2C;<active>;
 b,ADRESS,<default>{1 to 127}				{1 to 127} is mandatory

<l>RS232,<active>;
 b.BAUDRATE,<default>,{auto,19200,...}			Baudrate (optional, auto)
 3,NUMBER_OF_BITS,{8N1}				something like this, optional, auto)
 b,COMPORT,3						COM Port number (optional)

 <a>,TELNET,<active>;					server !!
<a>,SSH,<active>						server !!
 w, PORT,23							Portnumber
<s>,ADRESS,192....						
 b,TIMEOUT,<default>					Timeout (optional)				

<a>,HTTP,<active>;						server !!
<s>,ADRESS,http://...
b,TIMEOUT,<default>					Timeout (optional)

<a>,Terminal,<active>;					usually for CR only, interface, from where the program is called, no other options.

<a>,USB,<active>;						slave

 <a>,RC5,<active>;
 b,ADRESS,<default>,{1 to 32}				{1 to 32} 
 <a>,RC6,<active>;
b,ADRESS,<default>,{1 to 64}

<a>,CAN,<active>;
 b,ADRESS,<default>

<a>RADIO,<active>						Wireless interface


The commandrouter must know the access to the device and therefore the result of &HxxFF at start. The CR do not forward the &HxxFE and &HxxFF command for security reasons.


Hierarchical System

In a hierarchical system the CR resolves the announcements of lower level CR but otherwise keep the sequence. So only the actual CR  delivers the announcelist with the basic announceline at start and the reserved tokens at the end (tabs for clarification only):
<0>;c;...
	<c><m>...					#normal device 
	...
	<c>;aa, MYC INFO...				# no INDIVIDUALIZATION forwarded
	...
	<c>;c;...					#lower level CR start
		<c><m>...				#normal device 
		...
		<c>;aa, MYC INFO...			# no INDIVIDUALIZATION forwarded
		<c><dt>...
		...
	<c>;aa, MYC INFO...				#end of lower level CR
	…
	<c><m>					#other device 
	<c>;aa, MYC INFO...
	...
<c>;oa, INDIVIDUALISATION...
<c>;aa, INDIVIDUALISATION...

Identical devices with identical individualization are not allowed within a CR but for CR in different levels.
