Introduction

This paper describes the logic-device
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.
The program is in (early) development

The Idea

The idea is similar that, what IFTTT (If This Than That) implemented same years after the first edition of this document was published: create and execute rules, that exist within a device and between different devices.
Maybe, that IFTTT can be adapted to work with a MYC system.
The MYC sytax for rules is different and the LD, which execute the rules is in progress.
Rules for the devices are given with the device but the program to create the rules between the devices (RU), is not ready. They must be created manually now.
The RU must generate rules and send them to the LD,  which can be done by AI (in future).

Description

The LD can be described as a state-machine. It gets inputs (command with parameters) from the SK by the CR, handles them using a defined algorithm and the internal state, and send the result back to the CR, which forward them to the devices.
The algorithm uses the rules from the RU and the devices.
It also gets all answers from any attached device to update its state. Data from and to SK have a different prefix than data from devices because on data chanal is used only.
The LD has the status of switch, range and array memory commands but do not store othr memory content.
The internal state reflect the state of the MYC system. If a state of a FU change without a command, the LD get an info, which will modify the internal state of the LD.
The LD get rules from the RU and the rules of the device by the CR.
The LD will have the basic &H00 &H01 &H02 and &HFD own announcement only. These command &HFD without prefix are used by the CR to check that the LD is alive: The CR answers with $HFD04. The &H01 &H02 commands is used to transfer rules data.

The LD may provide some special functions as providing time data. This is not yet defined.

I did not found a state machine program, that can be used as LD, and most of them are not open source. The effort to write a program for the LD is less that expected.
If the program is finished, it will be part of the CR. This simplifies data transfer and is faster.
