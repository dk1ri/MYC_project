Introduction

This paper describes the principles of skins of a MYC system.
This is a description of possible skins and their environment.
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.

Some explanation

Skins (SS / SK) 
are used to control a MYC system.
A skin in a MYC System may be one of the following:
-	a simple terminal program 
-	a simple switch
-	a third party control program
-	a full control program

Terminal program
A simple terminal  can be used to connect the CR. You must know the MYC syntax and find out the accepted commands. It is not comfortable but working. If there is no CR, you can use the I2C – RS232 converter to control FU with I2C interface. It provides a restricted simulation of a CR. See  https://dk1ri.de/dhw/i2c_rs232_interface.txt or https://dk1ri.de/dhw/i2c_rs232_interface.pdf.
You can control a FU also directly via USB, RS232, or other I2C Interfaces, depending on the interfaces of the FU.

Simple switch SS
A simple simple or in general a control device with a limited number of predefined functions has “r” (require to operate) and “s” (require to answer) announcements for communication with the CR only. The real function in a system of a “r” or “s” command is defined by rules.
The device may have other o / a commands, which are used during configuration. The commands are not transferred to the final announcement list.
Additionally a simple switch has the announcements of the reserved commands.
The SS device send “r”  and “s” commands, but do do listen to any command except “a” during configuration. 
“r” and “s” announcements are added to the full announcement-list.
The RU will provide rules with direct commands to translate the “r” and “s” commands to commands of FU and the LD will execute them. If there is no rule the LD sent these commands back to the CR and the CR drop them.


Third party control program
A third party control program usually require a MYC interface. This program may behave like a higher level MYC System, a SK or a SS.

Full control program
A full control program can use all function delivered by the system via the full announce-list.
A web-server for this is available. For details see [13]
Other solution are possible as well.
