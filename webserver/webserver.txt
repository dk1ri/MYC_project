Introduction

This paper describes a special SK – a webserver. It is a user interface for a MYC system.
A browser should have access to this webserver and is the real SK (skin).
For more details of the MYC system please check the reference.
The program is not finished!

Definitions and formats

see https://dk1ri.de/myc/Definitions.txt or https://dk1ri.de/myc/Definitions.pdf

Status

Apache webserver (XAMPP) on windows set up
All commands are working; may be with some restrictions.
USB interface to one devices is working (but may be changed)

Some limitations

The commandrouter has no interface to devices yet and a solution without the commandrouter should work as a first step.
So the webserver has some limitations:
one device at the same time only.
It is necessary to start three programs: browser, web-server and a python program for the device interface.
I did not found a solution to connect the webserver to USB directly. So data exchange is done by filetransfer using an additional python program. This cost time.
For read commands there is a delay (dead) time of 2 s after a command.
Windows only is tested (Win10) with firefox browser.
The MYC protocol has no limitations with the number of elements of some commands and the use of descriptions is not mandatory. With the usage of the webserver descriptions for large memories e.g. are necessary. Before using a device with a webserver it shoiukd be checked, wether there are meaningful results.
- ext is not supported
- ALPHA and restioctions of manual nuric input is not supprted
- some OPTIONs are not supported

Starting / preparations

The following programs must be installed:
on the webserver (Win10 tested):
xampp (standard installation, nothing special [19])
Enable javascript for the browser
python (standard installation, nothing special [20]) 
usbserial is necessary for python

on the client:
a browser (firefox is used) 

on the webserver:
open Powershell
cd  C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python_version\Scripts
(you must replace yourname and version with your data)
pip.exe install usbserial
or 
C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python_version\python.exe -m pip install usbserial

move the original \xampp\htdocs to another directory, (if you need this for later usage).
download a new htdocs from [17], unzip and copy to xampp
create a new  \xampp\htdocs\devices
download a device from [18], unzip and copy the content to \xampp\htdocs\devices
For most existing devices these data are available.

Actual usage of the SK
	
on the webserver:
call the xampp control Panel
start modul Apache (at least)
it may be necessary to enable firewall for Apache web server
in a powershell:
cd \xampp\htdocs
C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python_version\python.exe USB_serial.py <COMPORT>

In a browser (on the same computer as the webserver) call
localhost/myc.php
If you use a different (remote) computer replace /localhost by the internetaddress are domainname.

Some tips for usage, which may help:
- to unselect a switch of an or command “control” + mouse-click!
- for switches and range commands: if you change the stack, the new values are shown and the operating requests are ignored, if a read command is checked.. You must initiate changes of the new stack by another command.
- Strings (for memory data) can be entered in hex or binary format by starting with &H or &B. If a character not belonging to this format is found the binary / hex format is ended. To enter a “0” when in binary input mode you must enter &T first.
- Entering numbers manually, the right format must be observed. For some formats negative values are not allowed. Single and double must be (-)0.xxxe(-)xx. Wrong data are ignored.
- for entering data of commands with more than one value (ob, on, of) the separation character is blank (“ ”). So when you want to enter a “ ” for strings you must write &H20. Received data are printed as printable characters(including space) or &Hxx. Separator for multiple elements of ob / on and f commands is “ . “.
- The number of entries for stacks and memory positions is not limited. But it is recommended, that the device delivers suitable descriptions with MUL and ADD using a small number of entries (< 100).

Other devices
For devices not found in [18] you can create your own.
create the directory \xampp\devices\your_new_device
copy your announcefile to this directory
open powershell
cd \xampp\htdocs
C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python_version\python.exe helper_202210.py
Syntax errors in the announcement file may create a crash of this program or the webserver.

Other languages:
The names for labels given by the announcements cannot be changed yet, but the (default) labels and names defined by the web-server. English and german is available now, others can be added in the _lang file (“;” is the separator)

Some additional explanations

I did some basic HTML programming earlier, and this is my first PHP program; so some enhancement have to be done.

My intention was:
- the web-server should work without the need of internet access (standalone).
- the programming should be as simple as possible and require as less resources as possible to work on simple equipment as an old raspberry.
- the programming should be as simple as possible, so that it works with all browsers.
- the web-server do not use a database program, but calculate many data at the first start.
 - the usage should be simple (there is a lot to do)
- the web-pages will be completely dynamic, so that all kinds of announce-lists can be used.

Later additions:
- The user calls his own individual web site and get his personal web layout.
- Functions may disappear when a device disappears.
- The labels of those functions may disappear or be grayed out.
- The user should find a knob to switch to an edit mode.
- In this mode the web page behaves like a web editor. The user can modify those functions defined by the full announcement-list.
- So the user can define his own colors and view of the functions in the edit mode and use it later on.
- The result is stored in a user individual config file or data base.
- For simple usage preconfigured files (skins) can be used.

External programs

Because I found no simple way for the web-server to communicate with USB device, an additional pyton script is necessary.. The web-server create file file with the data to send, and wait for an answer (for answer commands).
The script USB_serial read the file, send data to the device, wait for answer (for answer commands) and put it to a file.
The web-server read it, and update the values and display the page

My Test environment

I work with one windows laptop (Win10)
For development of the pages I use PhpStorm, and I installed a web-server (XAMPP)..
