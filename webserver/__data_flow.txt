The wen-page is one forms only.
$_POST contains only data of changed values.
To use old data as selected selects text and device data $_SESSION array is used.

data formats:
The python programs are sensitive for syntax error of the __annoncemnts file 
The program will crash (intentionally). You need some python knowlegde to detect the errors :(

file ___announcements: original announcements

files created by by helper_replace_cr.py:
_anounce_data: pure announcements (no comments and rules) 

files created by helper_create_initial files
_all_answer_tokens: find answercommand lines for helper_get_device_data
_token_for_website: 
o <operatetoken> pure operate without ext
m <answertoken> <corresponding_operatetoken>
number_of_answer  must be number_of_operate + 1 for "o"
it is assumed, that there is one ext line only
a <answertoken> for pure answertoken

files created by helper_get_trx.py:
program for telnet only!
Because the program do not know rule, there may be timeouts!
_all_answer_data: token data (hex)

files created by helper_sort_by_chapter.py:
_chapter_names: names of chapters
announce_lines_<chapter> pure announcements by chapter with added stack and memory selectors; no ext-lines
data_for_website_<chapter> token data ; data as per answer of device + selectors (to be used and updated (?) by website)


data flow:
$SESSION["trx_dat_key"] $SESSION["trx_dat_value"] $SESSION["answer_real"] and $SESSION["other"] are created as arrays 
with the first call of action.php.
With first call of action.php or change of chapter trx_real is calculated and copied to $_SESSION[trx_data]

$_POST contains token => value data. If data is an aray with key => 0 data, data is converted to to key11 key2...
These data are stored in $SESSION[trx_data].
From $_POST commands to devices are generated (if value != $SESSION[$trx_real] of token).
(check of validity is done by generate_command() as well)
For answer commands answer converted to real values and stored in in $SESSION["answer_real"] (token-> data)
The next page is created by using the $SESSION data (not $_POST)




$SESSION["post"]
- is resetted, when the chapter is changed
- contain the data of trx_real (token -> pointer_to_value_show_in_the_GUI|value_show_in_the_GUI
  (this depends on command)
